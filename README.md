# EXIF Image Viewer
##  A simple image and EXIF viewer made with PyQT5 and exifread
This program was made as a programming assignment for the Human Computer Interaction course. 

It allows users to load one or more images and view them, do basic manipulation(zoom and rotation), and read the EXIF data from that image. If there is location data in a picture, the user can view a map with a pin indicating where the photo was taken.
